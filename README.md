Building a responsive form/database prototype for Redwood Community Action Agency.

user-interface.php is the main controller PHP that includes all the other necessary PHP/HTML files. As such, this is the main file to look at. 

A sample Oracle database that could potentially be attached to this form in the future is included in the database_files directory, with tables already created.
