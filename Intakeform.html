		still be sheltered, but management must be involved in the decision. 
		Management or emergency back up should<br /> 
		also be involved if the youth has a history of violence or recent suicide 
		attempt(s).<br />

	<p>
		CHECK: probation status. Call the appropriate number below, idenity yourself as 
		working at YSB,<br />
		and ask if the youth is ward/ 602. You will need to give them the youth's 
		full name and DOB. Youth<br />
		who are wards cannot be sheltered.<br />
