	<p><strong>!!! Before completing this, please ensure caller/ youth data is filled out 
	on opposite side!!!</strong></p>
	<br />
	<p> <strong>CHECK</strong> the "Do Not Shelter" list at the front of the Com Log. If the youth is 
	not on the list, proceed.</p>
	<label><strong>ASK</strong>: Why is shelter needed?

	<p> 
		<strong>EXPLAIN</strong>: Basic YSB rules and policies. NO drug use, no violence, 
		outing/curfew time is case by case, 
		most stays are short. We have 24-hour staff, provide food and basic 
		necessities, and 
		have Internet access. We go on fun outings! Make sure to mention that YSB 
		is NOT a lock-down
		facility, and that all stays are VOLUNTARY.
	</p> <br /> 

	<p>
		If you are speaking with a guardian or other adult calling for a youth, 
		you should now inform
		them that you need to speak to the youth in order to complete the screening 
		process.

	<p>
		If a youth is ok with us contacting their guardian, great! If they are not, 
		it is possible that they can 
		still be sheltered, but management must be involved in the decision. 
		Management or emergency back up should
		also be involved if the youth has a history of violence or recent suicide 
		attempt(s).
	</p>

	<p>
		CHECK: probation status. Call the appropriate number below, idenity yourself as 
		working at YSB,
		and ask if the youth is ward/ 602. You will need to give them the youth's 
		full name and DOB. Youth
		who are wards cannot be sheltered: <br/>
		Call: Monday-Friday 8am-4:30pm 445-7401 / Weekends or after 4:30pm: 445-7644</p>
	<p>
		Once you've completed the steps above, please check one of the following:

			<input type="radio" id="will_stay" name="stay" value="yes" />
